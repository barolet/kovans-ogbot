===Q: How do I run the bot in Windows?===

A: Download the Windows version, decompress it and run OGBot.exe

===Q: How do I run the bot in Linux?===

A: Download the generic version. Under Linux, the libraries required by the bot are usually provided by the distributions in form of packages, so getting the work to work is pretty straightforward. For example, under Ubuntu the following packages are required:
 # *python-qt4* for !PyQt.
 # *libqt4-core* and *libqt4-gui* for QT.
 # *python2.4* for Python.
In other distros their names might differ but not much. 
After installing them just run runbot.sh

===Q: I found some error in the bot, how do I report it?===

A: Go to the issues tab and open a new issue, then follow the instructions. 

===Q: What libraries does the bot depend on?===
A: These:
  # Python 2.4 or newer.
  # QT 4.0 or newer, by Trolltech.
  # !PyQt4 (python bindings for QT).


===Q: How do I reset the bot?===

A: Delete the files in the directory files/botdata.

===Q: My language is not supported. Can I contribute a translation?===

A: Sure. What you have to do is create a new translation file for your language and place it in the languages directory. You should use english.ini as a template, as there are further instructions in it. If it works send it to me and I will include it in the next release. Non-occidental languages should work also.

===Q: Can I help improve the bot?====

A: All contributions are welcome. The basic requirement to be able to contribute in the development is the knowledge of Python, although to mess with some other parts, knowing other things is required. For example to mess with communication with OGame servers you need to know a bit of HTTP, HTML and probably Regexps, and to mess with interface you need to know QT.
If you want to use part or all of OGbot's code in your project, you can if you follow the GPL license requisites.

===Q: How do I run the multi-platform source version of the bot in Windows?===

A: The easiest and recommended way to run the bot in Windows is to use the prepared version, but it is possible to use the generic version. These are the steps:

 #. Download & install Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/)
 #. Download & install QT 4 GPL for Windows (http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows)
 #. Download & install !PyQt v4 GPL for Windows (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php)

Then:
 #. Right-click on "My Computer" and select "Properties"
 #. Click the "Advanced" tab
 #. Click "Environment Variables"
 #. In the system variable PATH include "C:\Qt\4.2.2\bin;C:\Python25" (assuming you installed QT and Python in their default locations).

After all that, execute runbot.bat and it _should_ work.
