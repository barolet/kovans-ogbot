# NOTES ON TRANSLATION:
# ---------------------
# The contents of this file are messages searched in the HTML source of some OGame pages.
# This means that, care must be put to translate with the EXACT strings that appear in the OGame pages.
# Small details like for example exclamations and punctuation symbols missing, or even spaces,
# can prevent the bot from working.
#
# WARNING: Most translations are case sensitive.
#
# Be sure to save the file in the same charset as the your OGame pages. If your OS is in the same
# language as your OGame pages, there should be no problem.
# Otherwise you'll need to know the charset OGame uses (as appears in the tag meta http-equiv="content-type)
# and then use an editor which supports saving to different charsets (p.e. Notepad++).
