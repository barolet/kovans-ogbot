- Now which planet will be attacked next is determined by a resource simulator that sorts target planets by quantity of potentially produced resources since last attack, and also taking distance into account.
- Possibility to choose which planet or planets are source of attacks. Moons are also allowed.
- Multi-language support. By now Spanish, English and Italian are included with the bot. To add one language just put the .ini file in the languages directory. Non-occidental languages should work also.
- Command line switch to have different configuration sets at once (example: --workdir uni18).
- Increases number of sent espionage probes until defense or buildings information is achieved.
- Redesigned user interface.
