# NOTES ON TRANSLATION:
# These are not messages that are shown to the bot user, are messages searched in the OGame pages.
# This means that, for example, if if some word starts in lowercase here, but in the servers starts in uppercase, the bot WILL NOT work. Same applies for local accents (á, ü...), excamations and punctuation symbols missiong... etc.
# Care must be put to translate with the EXACT strings that appear in the OGame pages.
