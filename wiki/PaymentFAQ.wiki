===Q: How does payment work?===

A: It's simple: You send an SMS to the number of your country, and you will receive another SMS with a code. When you enter that code in the white text box and click Send, you will start downloading the bot. The amount in the orange rectangle will be charged to you phone bill.

===Q: Will I have access to future versions?===

A: The access code has a validity of one month. After that it stops working. This means that you can download new versions for one month since you send the SMS. *The downloaded versions will not stop working after that month* (unless OGame interface changes, in this case all bots will probably stop working).

===Q: You say that an SMS must be sent, but for my country there is no number for SMS, only for phone calls.===

A: For some countries payment through SMS is not supported, only payments through phone call. The price is approximately the same. 
The procedure is as follows: you call and you will listen to a pre-recorded message in the language of your country. After the required call time, the machine will dictate the code, which you should write down.

===Q: My country doesn't appear in the list===

A: Some countries are not supported yet, sorry. More countries will be added in the future (for instance Turkey and China are already scheduled), and also an alternative payment method for unsupported countries will be added.
